# Java Mini Projects â˜•  

A collection of Java mini-projects and practice exercises exploring core concepts such as **OOP, exception handling, strings, generics, lambda expressions, multithreading, and more**.  
This is a space where I experiment with everything from objects and generics to threads and streams. Not big apps, just lots of tiny battles with Java concepts.
Each program is designed to focus on one or two Java features, making it easier to practice in small, targeted chunks.  


## ðŸ“– Concepts Covered

- âœ… Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)  
- âœ… Exception Handling (custom exceptions, try-with-resources)  
- âœ… Strings, StringBuilder & StringBuffer  
- âœ… Sorting arrays and collections  
- âœ… Generics in classes and methods  
- âœ… Lambda expressions & Streams API  
- âœ… Multithreading & concurrency utilities  


## ðŸš€ How to Run a Project

This repository contains multiple small Java projects that demonstrate core concepts like OOP, multithreading, exceptions, generics, lambdas, and more.  
Each project is **self-contained** and can be run independently.

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vivisn00b/Java-Mini-Projects.git
   cd Java-Mini-Projects
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder you want to run (example: Smart Library System):
   ```bash
   cd smartlibrarysystem
   ```
3. Compile the source code
   ```bash
   javac -d out src/smartlibrary/*.java
   ```

4. Run the program
   ```bash
   java -cp out smartlibrary.Main
   ```

   > ðŸ”‘ Each project has its own `Main.java` as the entry point. Run that file to execute the project.


## ðŸŒ± Why This Repo Exists

Learning Java can feel overwhelming when topics are studied in isolation.
This repo is my practice lab, where I implement small exercises to build real muscle memory. Instead of one big project, itâ€™s a growing collection of concept-focused mini-projects.
